//  A Set in JavaScript is a collection of unique values, which means that it doesn't allow duplicate values. It's similar to an array, but with the added constraint that all its elements are unique.

// You can create a Set using the Set constructor, like this:

let mySet = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

// You can also create an empty set and add elements to it later using the add() method:

let mySet2 = new Set();
mySet.add(1);
mySet.add(2);
mySet.add(3);
